# myAmerica Hackathons
This is a growing repository of challenge questions, problems and datasets for hackathons and other events.  The hope is that these challenge questions, problems and datasets can be used in partnership with government sponsors to investigate items of interest.  We welcome your input!

If there are specific questions you would like to see as part of a future hackathon using national lands and waters datasets, or other Department of the Interior datasets, tell us by [opening an issue here](https://github.com/usinterior/hackathons/issues) you can suggest topics and / or datasets for consideration during future events. Please note that this repository is a work in progress and subject to change.

##Challenge Questions - Set #1

###Big Picture Challenge

Combine natural resource and mapping data, with soundscapes data, electronic health record data so that a health care provider can readily prescribe a treatment plan that connects a patient to a nature experience to "Walk off the War".

For any of these challenges, we’ve included some datasets we think might help get at the answers, but of course participants are encouraged to use and / or combine datasets across challenges as they see fit, or augment with outside data.

###Challenge Question #1: 

Can activities within public lands and waters be prescribed by healthcare providers to Veterans?  

####The Data:

[VistA for Education](http://knowledge.amia.org/onc-ntdc/vista-1.379752) - a free EHR solution that allows users to interact as a health care practitioner with mock patient data.

Bureau of Land Management’s [National Conservation Lands](http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/prog/blm_special_areas/NLCS.html) - see the Challenge Question #1 Folder for datasets representing National Monuments, Wilderness Areas, Historic Trails, etc.

###Challenge Question #2: 

Can existing datasets collected by the National Park Service and US Dept. of the Interior be used to help Veterans identify serene locations to relieve PTSD, and help them transition back to society?

####The Data:

See Challenge Question #2 folder for datasets.

CONUS Sounds Model Datasets
Parks Night Skies Dataset
[Recreation One Stop Dataset](https://ridb.recreation.gov/) (RIDB) - see documentation on [how to request data](https://ridb.recreation.gov/RIDBWebSvcManual.pdf) through web services.
[BISON API](http://bison.usgs.ornl.gov/#api) -Biodiversity Information Serving Our Nation dataset

###Challenge Question #3

Can we envision using weather data from NOAA (also applied through this challenge) and combine it with campground information to provide real-time recommendations and / or planning tools for users on demand?

####The Data:

NOAA weather data feeds and associated DOI information.

##Legal Stuff
